1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

      - Jest `Describe` breaks your test suite into components. Jest `It` is for performing individual tests.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

      - Building out applications can get very complex very quickly. Test Driven Development allows for you to slow down and think about your expectations for a possible solution, giving us the chance to seamlessly integrate our solution with an existing code base to avoid side effects.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

      - Unit tests
      - Integration tests
      - Regression Tests
